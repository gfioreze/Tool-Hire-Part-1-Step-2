## Little Tutorial on git : 

#### Adding Changes : 
* Make changes to file 
* command : 'git status' to see what changes have You made
* command : 'git add' to add changes(so choose which changes You want to add, and run git add multiple times for each of the changes)
* command : 'git commit -m "commit message" ' - to commit 
* command : 'git push' to push your commit to the server


#### Pulling Changes : 
* 'git pull' - to pull the changes(it will pull changes only for the branch You are on though)


#### Working w. multiple branches : 
* 'git checkout -b 'branch_name'' -> to create a branch and move to it 
* 'git checkout 'branch_name' -> to move to another branch (it has to already exit)
* 'git branch' -> it'll print all branches names
